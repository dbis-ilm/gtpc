GTPC Graph Database Benchmark

GPTC is a hybrid graph benchmark based on the [CH-benCHmark](https://db.in.tum.de/research/projects/CHbenCHmark/index.shtml) which combines the TPC-C and TPC-H benchmarks. The goal is to provide data and query workloads for hybrid transactional-analytical (HTAP) graph databases. 
In this repository we provide the data generator as well as all the benchmark queries formulated in Cypher for Neo4j. Please, see our [paper](https://doi.org/10.18420/BTW2023-05) for more details.
